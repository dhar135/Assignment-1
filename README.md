# Uniform Cost Search Assignment

This repository contains an implementation of the Uniform Cost Search algorithm as part of your Artificial Intelligence assignment.

## Files

- **[uniform_cost_search.ipynb](uniform_cost_search.ipynb)**  
  Contains the implementation of the Uniform Cost Search algorithm. The code sets up a graph with weighted edges and finds the minimum cost path from a starting node (0) to the goal node (7).

## Overview

The Uniform Cost Search algorithm is implemented in the function `uniform_cost_search` within the notebook. The algorithm uses a priority queue to explore nodes based on the accumulated cost and determines the minimum cost and corresponding path from the start node to any goal node.

## How to Run

1. Open the [uniform_cost_search.ipynb](uniform_cost_search.ipynb) notebook in Jupyter or Visual Studio Code's Notebook interface.
2. Run all cells to execute the algorithm.
3. The output will display the minimum cost from node 0 to node 7 and the path taken:
   - Example:
     ```
     Minimum cost from 0 to 7 is 10
     Path: [0, 4, 5, 18, 6, 7]
     ```

## Environment

- **Python Version:** 3.11.11  
- **Dependencies:** Utilizes Python's built-in `queue.PriorityQueue`
